# Introduction

Here we collect (and learn about) all possible useful information.

When programming Internet-applications, some basic networking knowledge about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite can be useful.

When it comes to streaming audio/video or other realtime communications, some specific protocols have been developed over the years. We explore them a bit in [StreamingProtocols](StreamingProtocols.md).

One particular interesting use-case that has been researched by audio professionals (and is also implemented by Apple in their OS's and therefore also known as **AppleMIDI**) is [RTP-MIDI](RTP-MIDI.md).

All previous links serve more as background-information.

Next we collect what could actually be useful for our project:

# WebRTC

- uses **SCTP**: Stream Control Transmission Protocol (transport layer protocol)
- uses **DTLS**: TLS for UDP- or SCTP-datagrams
- several Javascript API's:
  - `getUserMedia`
  - `RTCPeerConnection`
  - `RTCDataChannel` (similar API to websocket but latency)
  - `getStats`
- requires SIP, **SIP over websockets (RFC7118)**, XMPP (Jabber), ... for signaling
- The official examples:
  - https://webrtc.github.io/samples/
    - https://github.com/webrtc/samples

Golang:

- https://libs.garden/go/search?q=webrtc
  - https://pion.ly/

# MIDI

- https://github.com/ldrolez/free-midi-chords
    - Python-script to generate a midi-file for every chords (and chord-progressions) in all keys (7900+ midi-files)

Golang:

- https://libs.garden/go/search?q=midi
- https://github.com/gomidi/midi
  - contains a **WASM**-example that can talk to real midi-hardware from the webbrowser!

# Music theory / math

Golang:

- https://github.com/go-music-theory/music-theory

# Front-end audio/midi

- https://jazz-soft.net/doc/
  - used in [p2p-webrtc example](../examples/p2p-webrtc/index.html)

- https://github.com/joshreiss/Working-with-the-Web-Audio-API
  - many examples in tutorial-format about WebAudio
  - chapter 18 and 19 are about `AudioWorklet`'s (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Using_AudioWorklet)

- https://web.dev/audio-scheduling/
  - don't use `setTimeout` but `requestAnimationFrame` or *custom system?*

    - prescheduled audio events in Web Audio API

- https://blog.logrocket.com/build-native-audio-plugin-elementary/
  - an article about using the https://www.elementary.audio/ framework
    - Elementary is not **just** front-end:
      - for the front-end (web): https://www.elementary.audio/docs/packages/web-renderer
      - local on a machine (nodejs): https://www.elementary.audio/docs/packages/node-renderer
      - as a VST/AUv3-plugin for in a DAW: https://www.elementary.audio/docs/packages/plugin-renderer
    - they have commercial aspirations:
      - VST/AUv3-plugin not free ($$$)
      - a marketplace for plugins: https://www.elementary.audio/marketplace
      - ...

- Soundfonts
  - https://github.com/gleitz/midi-js-soundfonts

# WASM and Golang

- https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-go
  - go-interface around https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer
    - wasmer allows running `.wasm`-executables even outside of the browser

# Audio processing

- https://engineering.atspotify.com/2022/06/meet-basic-pitch/
  - research from
    - Spotify's Audio Intelligence Lab (https://research.atspotify.com/audio-intelligence/)
    - https://www.soundtrap.com/
  - How to convert audio to midi, fast and in realtime
  - uses ML (Machine Learning)
  - ...

Golang:

> Most likely all audio-stuff in golang requires some non-Go-code (`cgo`, `clang`, ...) under the hood. This is **not** ideal!
> We must consider this as potential time-stealing problems when building/testing and at a later stage supportability.
> TODO: keep track of additional dependencies on each platform!

- https://github.com/faiface/beep
  - uses https://github.com/hajimehoshi/oto
    - a low-level library to play sound
    - cross-platform, even for mobile OS's?
- https://github.com/MarkKremer/microphone
  - uses https://github.com/gordonklaus/portaudio
    - a Go-interface around the http://www.portaudio.com/ audio-library
      - cross-platform but apparently not really for mobile?

# Websockets

See [Websockets.md](Websockets.md) for some notes on the Websocket-protocol as per RFC's and other useful websites.

Golang:

- https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/websocket
  - (per documentation:) *lacks features*
- https://github.com/gorilla/websocket
  - (per documentation:) *complete and tested*, passes *Autobahn Test Suite*
    - https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-testsuite
  - probably the most used websocket-implementation
- https://github.com/nhooyr/websocket
  - passes *Autobahn Test Suite*
  - Some interesting features that **might** make it more useful for our project
    - Zero alloc reads and writes
    - Supports compiling to **WASM**
    - solves a problem with closing handshake that gorilla still has (https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/issues/448)
- https://github.com/gobwas/ws
  - written for *mail.ru* to handle millions of users checking their e-mail, see https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/million-websockets-and-go-cc58418460bb
  - speaks of *Zero Copy HTTP Upgrades* (https://github.com/gobwas/ws#zero-copy-upgrade)
    - this is when **one** client's HTTP-connection gets upgraded to a `ws`-connection
    - important for when you have many millions of clients checking e-mail
    - not very important for our use case since a jamming session would reasonably have only about a dozen people
      - unless we want to make it **MMOJ** (Massive Multiplayer Online Jamming) :wink: but even then the *joining a jam-session*-part is not the real bottleneck
